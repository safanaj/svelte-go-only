Experiment with SvelteJS and Golang (with grpc-web)

In this project I just want to learn how to use svelte.js and grpc-web using golang.

In this project I experiment a bit with embed also to make an executable that is self-contained (including html/css/js files).

This is heavily inspired by this demo: https://github.com/agrism/grpc-web-svelte
